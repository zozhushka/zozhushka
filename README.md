Hi there! I'm Katya and I'm an ordinary girl from Russia.
I’m interested in neuroscience (neurobiology, neurolinguistics, neuropsychology, neuropsycolinguisctics) and data science.
I’m currently learning linguistics, neurolinguistics and python programming.
I’m looking to collaborate on some projects to develop my skills.
